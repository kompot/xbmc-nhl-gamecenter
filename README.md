xbmc-nhl-gamecenter
===================

XBMC-NHL-GameCenter is a video plugin for Kodi (formerly known as XBMC) that allows you to watch NHL GameCenter videos. [View the discussion thread here.](http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=207178)

This plugin requires a valid subscription to NHL GameCenter, and is subject to local blackouts imposed by the NHL.

**THIS PLUGIN IS COMPLETELY UNOFFICIAL AND IS NOT ENDORSED BY THE NHL OR ANYONE ASSOCIATED WITH THE NHL.**

Notable features:
-----------------

* Watch the following game types in high quality (up to 5000kbps and 60fps):
    - Live games
    - Recently live and upcoming games
    - Archived games
    - Condensed games
    - Game highlights
    - French streams (when available)
* Each game displays a unique matchup image showing the logos of the two teams that are playing.
* Ability to specify an HTTP/HTTPS proxy to be used only by this add-on.
* The list of games clearly shows which games have yet to start, are in progress, and have ended.
* The list of games optionally shows the current score for the game.
* Hassle-free operation. You should only have to concern yourself with how your favorite team is playing. Leave the implementation details to me. I will consider it a personal failure if I ever have to give troubleshooting instructions that begin with something to the effect of "try deleting your cookies and see if that fixes it."

Am I missing a feature that you're just dying to have?  Let me know what it is, and I'll consider implementing it!
